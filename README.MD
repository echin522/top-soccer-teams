# Soccer Game Score Coding Challenge

Simple program to keep track of the head-to-head scores of a soccer league. Three different versions were created in Ruby, Typescript, and Python to explore the strengths and weaknesses of each language. 

All programs will run with the latest version of their respective languages, however the Python solution requires v3.6+.
